## Detecting Fake News with Natural Language Processing

##### by Zach Merritt, Deepak Nagaraj, and Michael Powers
##### December 2018

The goal of this project is to examine different approaches to accurately classify "fake news" using natural language processing ("NLP") methods on the text of news articles. We rely on two data sets that were generated in a previous research project. We compare two different NLP approaches to fake news detection: automated machine learning on engineered features, and deep learning on word embeddings.

1) feature_building/TPOT_Ling_Feature_Model.ipynb implements automated machine learning on engineered features

2) deep_learning_models.py implements deep learning on word embeddings
