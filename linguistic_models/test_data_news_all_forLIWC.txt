49,"Eddie Lacy joins Philadelphia Eagles on one-year deal.  Eddie Lacy signed a 1 year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles earlier this week.  The deal was purportedly for $2 million per year.  Lacy and Jamaal Charles had previously visited the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle was rumored to be a likely landing spot for Lacy.  However, the Eagles appeared to have swooped in at the last minute to offer Lacy a better deal according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport.  Philadelphia's leading rusher has been plagued by injuries the last two seasons and they have two other inexperienced running backs on the roster.  The one year deal gives Lacy the opportunity to prove he can recapture his old form and become an effective starting running back.  The deal seems to fill one hole in Philadephia's roster."

71,"Superman to Not Appear in ""Justice League"" Movie  When the new trailer for ""Justice League"" appeared Saturday, most fans, and even casual viewers alike, noted the obvious lack of the iconic Superman. Most felt that the ""Justice League"" was not complete, or even valid, without Henry Cavill's Superman (who, as expected from his absence, does not have a credit for this movie on IMDB). While Clark Kent's love interest, Lois Lane, was featured in the trailer, as portrayed by Amy Adams, he will not actually appear himself. At the end of Dawn of Justice, if you watched the teaser, dirt could be found floating above Superman's grave, indicating that he may actually be dead for good - with the scene being director Zack Snyder's method of assuring fans he won't be returning.   Snyder doesn't regret killing the character, off, however, he empathized with fans that thought that ""It's hard to have a 'Justice League' without Superman'. Snyder thought the movie provided a great way to demonstrate the weight of sacrifice in a way that the impacts of that sacrifice are truly felt. Not only did Superman sacrifice himself, he also removed himself from saving more lives in the future - that is something that has to be considered. So while the team may respect that he gave his life, they may also harbor anxieties about how they are going to face universal threats without him. ""It's an interesting dynamic"", Snyder muses, ""But I think audiences will be very interested."""
